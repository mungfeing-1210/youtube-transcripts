**视频标题: Claude Code的秘密：来自其工程师的分享**

这帮助我理解，哦，原来我真正想表达的是这个，因为它犯了这些错误，或者做了我意料之外的事情。然后，我从这种试探性开发中学到的经验，会将其清除。接着，这些经验能帮助我为实际的功能开发撰写一份更好的计划规范。这在以前是绝不可能做到的，因为成本太高了，你不可能不经规划就贸然派一名工程师去开发一个你尚未明确需求的功能。

但现在，因为Claude能深入你的代码库并执行任务，你可以从中学习，这些经验能为你的实际开发计划提供参考。

**发言人1：** 是的，我想我可以先谈谈我的看法，我也很好奇你是如何使用它的。

**发言人2：** 我觉得对我来说，可能有几种不同的模式。其中一种是原型开发模式。就像传统的工程原型开发一样，你希望构建一个尽可能简单的东西，它能触及所有系统，这样你就能对这些系统有一个大致的了解，识别未知因素，并梳理整个流程。

所以，我做的和你一样，丹。Claude会执行任务，然后我观察它在哪里出错，接着我会让它直接放弃并重来。只需按两次Esc键，回到上一个检查点，然后再次尝试。

我想可能还有另外两种任务。一种是Claude能够一次性完成的任务，我对它能做到这一点非常有信心。所以，我只会告诉它要做什么，然后我会切换到另一个标签页，按下Shift+Tab自动接受，接着去做其他事情，或者去处理我的其他Claude任务。

但还有一种更复杂的功能开发。这些任务在过去可能需要几个小时的工程时间。对于这类任务，我通常会按下Shift+Tab进入计划模式，先就计划达成共识，然后再让它编写任何代码。我认为这其中真正的难点在于，随着每个模型的更新，这种边界会以一种令人惊讶的方式发生变化。新模型更智能，所以需要计划模式的边界被推得更远了一些。比如，以前你需要制定计划，现在可能就不需要了。我认为这是一种普遍趋势：以前作为脚手架或辅助工具的东西，随着更先进模型的出现，它会被整合到模型本身中，模型会随着时间逐渐吞并一切。

那么，你如何看待构建一个代理框架，既能避免你投入大量时间构建的东西在三个月后新版Claude发布时就被模型本身所整合？也就是说，你如何判断哪些是值得构建的，而哪些只是暂时无法实现，但未来模型升级后就能实现，所以我们现在不花时间去做的？

**发言人3：** 我认为我们构建的大多数东西，只要我们认为能提升Claude Code的能力，即使这意味着我们会在三个月后将其淘汰，我们也会去构建。如果可以的话，我们甚至希望能在三个月后就将其淘汰。

**发言4：

我们可能需要实现很多功能，比如记忆。如何实现记忆功能呢？因为我们内部有许多不同的产品，你可以直接生成 Claude 子代理，让它们去了解其他三款产品是如何实现记忆的。这样就可能实现隐性的代码共享，你不需要 API，也不需要特意去询问任何人。你只需问一句：“我们之前是怎么做的？”然后就可以利用这些最佳实践来构建你自己的功能。你也可以对开源项目这样做，因为有大量的开源项目，开发者们可能已经为此（记忆功能）工作了一年，而且做得非常出色。你可以去了解他们发现了哪些模式，以及你想实现哪些模式。

完全

以下是将英文视频字幕转录为流畅的中文可读文稿：

它能自动识别这些信息，并且你可以通过多种方式灌输这种“记忆”。例如，你可以说“@Claude，将其添加到quadmd”，或者“@Claude，编写一个测试”。这是一种简单有效的方式，可以确保功能不会出现倒退。

现在，我再也不会不好意思要求别人编写测试了，因为这真的非常简单。我想，我们几乎100%的测试都是由Claude编写的。如果测试写得不好，我们就不提交；如果写得好，就保留下来。

此外，代码规范检查规则（lint rules）也是一个重要的方面。对于那些需要经常强制执行的规范，我们内部有一系列代码规范检查规则，而Claude编写了其中100%的规则。这通常只需要在拉取请求（PR）中写一句“@Claude，编写这条代码规范检查规则”即可。

目前存在一个问题，就是如何实现自动化。Cat和我的普遍看法是，我们首先会观察高级用户的行为，第一步是让产品具有可定制性（hackable），这样最优秀的用户就能发现并实现这些酷炫的新功能。但真正的挑战在于，如何将这些功能推广给所有其他用户。对我来说，我将自己归类为“普通用户”群体。比如，我不太会使用Vim，也没有那种复杂的T-box配置。我的设置相当普通。所以，如果一个功能连我都会用，那它很可能也会被其他普通工程师所使用。

这很有趣。能详细说说吗？因为我一直在思考如何打造一个既具有足够的可扩展性和灵活性，能让高级用户发现你从未设想过的新颖用法，同时又足够简单，让任何人都能轻松上手并高效使用的产品。并且，你还能将高级用户发现的用法融入到基础体验中。你们是如何考虑这些设计和产品决策，从而实现这一点的？

总的来说，我们认为每个开发环境都略有不同，因此我们系统的每个部分都必须具有可扩展性，这一点非常重要。从状态栏到添加自定义的斜杠命令，再到钩子（hooks），这些钩子允许你在Claude Code的几乎任何步骤中插入确定性逻辑。我们认为这些是我们提供给每位工程师的基本构建模块，他们可以自由使用。

至于插件（Plugins），它实际上是由我们团队的Daisy开发的。这是我们尝试让像我们这样的普通用户更容易地将这些斜杠命令和钩子集成到日常工作流中的一种方式。插件的功能是让你能够浏览现有的MCP服务器、现有的钩子、现有的插件，或者说现有的斜杠命令，然后你只需在Claude Code中输入一个命令，就能将其拉取到自己的环境中。

产品领域有一个非常古老的理念，叫做“潜在需求”（latent demand）。我认为这可能是我个人思考产品以及下一步该构建什么的主要方式。这是一个非常简单的想法：你以一种可定制的、足够开放的方式构建产品，让人们可以将其“滥用”于它最初并非为之设计的其他用例。然后，你观察人们是如何“滥用”它的，再基于此进行开发，因为你知道那里存在需求，对吧？

比如，我在Meta工作时，我们所有的大型产品都是这样构建的。我认为几乎每一个大型产品都蕴含着这种潜在需求的萌芽。举个例子，像Facebook Dating这样的产品，它的灵感来源于我们观察用户资料浏览情况时发现，大约60%的浏览发生在异性之间，而且这些用户彼此并非朋友，这是一种传统的社交模式。于是我们想：“哦，也许如果我们推出一个约会产品，就能利用这种现有的需求。”

那很有趣。

对于Marketplace也是类似的情况。当时，Facebook群组中大约40%的帖子都是买卖帖子。所以我们意识到，人们正在尝试使用这个产品进行买卖。我们只需围绕这个需求构建一个产品，很可能会成功。

我们思考问题的方式与此类似，但我们也有一个优势，那就是我们是为开发者构建产品，而开发者喜欢折腾和定制各种东西。作为我们自己产品的用户，这让构建和使用它变得非常有趣。所以，就像我说的，我们构建了正确的扩展点，观察人们如何使用它，这就能告诉我们下一步该构建什么。

例如，我们收到了很多用户请求，他们说：“嘿，Claude Code老是问我要各种权限，但我当时正在外面喝咖啡，根本不知道它在请求权限。我怎么才能让它在Slack上提醒我呢？”于是，我们开发了钩子。Dixon开发了钩子，这样人们就可以在Slack上收到提醒，你可以为任何你想在Slack上收到提醒的事情设置提醒。所以，这很大程度上是因为人们真的想要做某件事，而我们不想亲自构建集成，所以我们开放了钩子接口，让人们自己去实现。

这让我想到了一个问题：你们最近发布了，或者说重新定位或重新命名了你们对Claude Code的描述，将其称为一个更通用的代理SDK。这是否也是受到某种潜在需求的驱动，即你们看到了你们所构建的产品具有更通用的用例？

以下是转录并整理后的中文文稿：

**视频标题: Claude Code 的秘密：来自其工程师的分享**

当没有一堆按钮和旋钮，只有一个空白文本框作为起点时，你们如何考虑让它变得直观易用？

>> 我们做了很多小细节，比如我们会教用户使用问号来查看提示。在 Claude Code 运行过程中，我们会显示提示。侧边有更新日志。我们还会告诉你“哦，有新模型发布了”或者在底部有一个通知区域来提醒你。我认为我们通过这些微妙的方式向用户介绍功能。另一件非常重要的事情是，确保所有基本概念都定义得非常清晰。例如，“hooks”（钩子）在开发者生态系统中有着普遍的含义，“plugins”（插件）也是如此。我们确保我们构建的东西与普通开发者听到这些词时立即想到的含义相符。

>> 还有一种“渐进式披露”的理念。比如，在 Claude Code 中，你随时可以运行它，然后按下 Ctrl+O 来查看模型所看到的完整原始文本。我们不会在一开始就向你展示这些，只有当它真正相关时才会。所以，当某个工具结果被折叠时，我们会提示你使用 Ctrl+O 来查看。我们不想在一开始就给你增加太多复杂性，因为这个工具几乎可以做任何事情。我认为我们还在探索另一个新的原则，那就是模型会教你如何使用它。你可以向 Claude Code 询问关于它自身的问题，它会查找自己的文档来告诉你。我们甚至可以做得更深入，例如，“斜杠命令”（slash commands）是人们可以使用的功能，但模型也可以调用斜杠命令。也许你看到模型调用了它，然后你就会想：“哦，原来我也可以这样做。”

>> 是的，是的，是的，很有趣。它发生了怎样的变化？你知道，当你们最初开始做 Claude Code 时，它似乎是一种独特的存在，一种通过命令行界面（CLI）使用人工智能的独特方式。其他人也有类似的东西，但这感觉像是一次转变，现在整个行业都在转向 CLI。这如何改变了你们对构建的思考方式、构建时的感受，以及你们如何应对这场竞争中的压力？

>> 我认为对我来说，模仿是最好的赞美。嗯，所以这很棒，很高兴看到其他人受到启发，正在构建所有这些其他东西。我认为这最终的目标就是激励人们为这项即将到来的、令人难以置信的技术构建下一个产品。这真的非常令人兴奋。就我个人而言，我不太使用其他工具。所以，通常当有新东西发布时，我可能会尝试一下，感受一下。但除此之外，我认为我们非常专注于解决我们和客户遇到的问题，并构建下一代产品。

>> 酷。太棒了。嗯，我也很喜欢采访的这一部分。

>> 我们回答了你团队的所有问题了吗？

>> 问题？

>> 哦，我们回答完我团队的所有问题了吗？让我看看。嗯，我想我们回答完了。嗯，我也很好奇你会如何回答关于“下架产品”（unshipping）的问题，因为如果你正在做这种人工智能驱动的开发，你会发布很多东西。你们团队很小，所以运营负担很大。

>> 我问这个问题是因为我认为我们在这方面做得不好。而且我有一种感觉，有些产品因此而显得有点混乱。特别是对于 Kora 来说，它的产品功能覆盖面很广，可以做很多不同的事情。比如，我们有一个邮件助手，你可以问它：“告诉我关于我正在进行的旅行。”它会浏览你所有的邮件，然后总结这次旅行。或者我们有一个功能，可以自动归档所有你不需要立即回复的邮件。然后，每天两次，你会收到一份简报，总结所有你可能需要看但不需要实际操作的事情，你只需滚动浏览一下就完成了。所有这些都带来了很多复杂性，例如邮件是如何分类的？所以现在我们有一个完整的视图，里面有所有的分类规则，你可以对它们进行排序等等，但这太复杂了，很难沟通。我希望保留所有的强大功能和灵活性，但同时你也不能看着屏幕说：“我完全

好的，这是将您的英文视频字幕转录并编辑为流畅中文可读文稿：

像个墓地。是的，我认为Instagram非常有原则。他们在产品和设计方面有非常明确的观点，那就是如果某个功能没有被至少一半的用户（比如50%的周活跃用户或类似指标）使用，他们就会直接删除它，然后去开发下一个能被更多人使用的功能。

我很喜欢这种做法。嗯，非常感谢。这次对话非常精彩。我很高兴能与你们交流，请继续努力创造。

感谢你们的邀请。是的，谢谢。

## 英文原文

What made it work really well is that quad code has access to everything that an engineer does at the terminal. Everything you can do, quad code can do. There's nothing in between. >> There's actually an increasing number of people internally at anthropic that are

using like a lot of credits like spending like over a,000 bucks every month. We see this like power user behavior. This is something that they teach in YC. If you can solve your own problem, it's much more likely you're solving the problem for others. There's

this like really old idea in product called latent demand. You build a product in a way that is hackable that is kind of open-ended enough that people can abuse it for other use cases it wasn't really designed for and you build for that cuz you kind of know there's

demand for it. Do you think the CLI is the final form factor? Are we going to using cloud code in the CLI primarily in a year or in 3 years or is there something else that's better [Music] This podcast is sponsored by Google. Hey

folks, I'm Omar, product and design lead at Google DeepMind. We just launched a revamped vibe coding experience in AI Studio that lets you mix and match AI capabilities to turn your ideas into reality faster than ever. Just describe your app and Gemini will automatically

wire up the right models and APIs for you. And if you need a spark, hit I'm feeling lucky and we'll help you get started. Head to a.studio/bild. studio/build to create your first app. >> Cat Boris, thank you so much for being here.

>> Thanks for having us. >> Yeah. Um, so for people who don't know you, you are the creators of Claude Code. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. It's uh I love Cloud Code. >> That's amazing to hear. That's what we

love to hear. Um I Okay, I think the place I want to start is when I first used it. Um, there was like this moment like I think it was around when uh Sonnet 37 came out where I was like I used it and I was like, "Holy this is like a completely new paradigm. It's

a a completely new way of thinking about code." And the the big difference was um you went all the way and just eliminated the text editor and you're just like all you do is like talk to the talk to the terminal and and that's that's it. Um, and you know, previous paradigms of AI

programming, pre previous harnesses have been like you have a text editor and you have the AI on the side and it's kind of like or it's a tab complete. So, take me through like that decision process that ar that that process of of architecting this new paradigm. How do you how did

you think about that?

>> Yeah, I think the the most important thing is it was not intentional at all. Okay. >> Uh, we we sort of ended up with it. So at the time when I joined Enthropic um we were still on different teams at the time. Um there was this previous

predecessor to quad code. It was called Clyde like CL C cliop. And it was this like research project you know it took like a minute to start up. It was this kind of like really heavy Python thing. It had to like run a bunch of indexing and stuff. And when I

joined I wanted to ship my first PR and I hand wrote it like a you know like a noob in a in a like I didn't know about any of these tools. >> Thank you for admitting that. U I didn't know any better and then I I put up this PR and um Adam Wolf who was

the um manager for our team for a while. He was my ramp up buddy and he just like rejected the PR and he was like you wrote this by hand. What are you what are you doing? Use Quide. Um cuz he was also hacking a lot on Quiet at the time.

And so I tried Quaid. I gave it the description of the task and it just like one shot at this thing >> and this was like you know sonnet 35. So I still had to fix a thing even for this kind of basic task and the harness was super old. So it took like 5 minutes to

turn this thing out and just took forever and um but it but it worked and I was just mind-blown that this this was even possible and they just kind of got the gears turning. maybe you don't actually need an IDE.

>> And then later on I was prototyping using the anthropic API and the easiest way to do that was just building a little app in the terminal cuz that way I didn't have to build a UI or anything. And I started just making a little chat app and then I just started thinking

maybe we could do something a little bit like Clyde. So let let me build like a little Clyde and it actually ended up being a lot more useful than that without a lot of work. And I think the biggest revelation for me was when we started to give the model

tools. It just started using tools and it was just it was this insane moment. Like the model just wants to use tools. Like we gave it bash and it just started using bash writing apple script to like automate stuff uh in response to questions. And I was like this is just

the craziest thing. I've never seen anything like this. Cuz at the time I had only used IDE with like you know like text editing a little like oneline autocomplete, multi-line autocomplete, whatever. Um, so that that's where this came from. It was this kind of

convergence of like prototyping but also kind of seeing what's possible in kind of like a very um rough way. >> Um, and this thing ended up being surprisingly useful and and I think it was the same for us. I think for me it was like kind of sonnet 4 opus 4. That's

where that magic moment was. I was like, "Oh my god, this this thing works." >> That's interesting. So like tell me about that that the tool moment because I think that is one of the special things about cloud code is it just writes bash and it's really good at it.

And I think a lot of um previous agent architectures or even anyone building agent today, your first instinct might be okay, we're going to give it a find file tool and then we're going to give it a uh open file tool and you you build all these like custom wrappers for you

know uh all the different actions you might want the agent to take, but Cloud Code just uses bash and it's like really good at it. So how do you think about um how do you think about what you learned from that?

Yeah, I think we're at this point right now where Quad Code actually has a bunch of tools. I think it's like a dozen or something like this. We we actually like add and remove tools most weeks. So, this changes pretty often. Um, but today there actually is a search uh there's a

tool for for searching. Um, and we do this for two reasons. One is the UX, so we can show the result a little bit nicer to the user because there's still a human in the loop right now for most tasks. Uh, and the second one is for permissions. So, if you say in your like

cloud code like settings.json JSON on this file you cannot read. We we have to kind of enforce this. Uh we enforce it for bash but we can do it a little bit more efficiently for if we have a specific search tool. Um but definitely we want to like unhip tools and kind of

keep it simple for the model. Um like last week or two weeks ago we unchipped the OS tool because in the past we needed it but then we actually built a way to enforce this kind of permission system for bash. Um, so in Bash, if we know that you're not allowed to read a

particular directory, Quad's not allowed to OS that directory. And because we can enforce that consistently, we don't need this tool anymore. Um, and this is nice because it's a it's a little less choice for Quad. A little less stuff in context.

>> Got it. And how do you guys split responsibility on the team?

>> Um, I would say Boris sets the technical direction and has been the product visionary for a lot of the features that we've come out with. I see myself as more of like a supporting role to make sure that um that one that like our pricing and packaging resonates with our

users. Um two making sure that we're shephering all our features across the launch process. So from like deciding all right like these are the prototypes that we should definitely ant food to like setting the quality threshold for ant fooding through to communicating

that to our end users. And um there's definitely some new initiatives that we're working on that uh I would say historically a lot of quad code has been built bottoms up like Boris and a lot of the core team members have just had these great ideas for to-do list sub

agents hooks like all these are bottoms up. As we think about expanding to more services and bring cloud code to our places, I think a lot of those are more like, all right, let's talk to customers. Let's bring engineers into those conversations and prioritize those

services and knock them out. >> Got it. What is ant fooding?

>> Oh, ant fooding is >> Oh, ant fooding. >> Oh, um it it means dog fooding. So, >> anthropic ant. I got it. >> Yeah. Our nickname for um internal employees is ant. And so uh ant fooding is our version of dog fooding. Uh

internally over I think 70 or 80% of ants uh technical anthropic employees use cloud code every day. And so every time we are thinking about a new feature, we push it out to people internally and we get so much feedback.

We have a feedback channel. I think we get a post every five minutes. And so you get really quick signal on whether people like it, whether it's buggy, um or whether uh it's not good and we should unchip it.

>> You can tell um you can tell that someone that is building stuff is using it all the time to build it. Uh because the the like its ergonomics just makes sense if you're trying to build stuff and that that only happens if you're like ant ant fooding.

Um I Yeah. Yeah. And I I think that that's a really interesting paradigm for building new stuff like that sort of bottoms up I make something for myself. Um tell me about that. >> Yeah. And C cat is also so humble. Um I think cat has a really big role in the

product direction also like it comes from everyone on the team and like these specific examples this actually came from everyone on the team like to-do lists and sub aents that was Sid Hooks Dixon shipped that plugins Daisy shipped that.

>> So like everyone on the team like these ideas come from everyone. Um, and so I think for us like we build this core agent loop and this kind of core experience and then everyone on the team uses the product all the time. Uh, and so everyone outside the team uses the

product all the time. And so there's just all these chances to build things that serve these needs. Like for example, like bash mode, you know, like the exclamation mark and you can type in bash commands. This was just like many months ago. I was using quad code and I

I was going back and forth between two terminals and just thought it was kind of annoying. Uh, and just on a whim, my asked squad to kind of think of ideas, the thought of this like exclamation mark bash mode. And then I was like, great, make it pink and then ship it.

It just did it. And like that that's the thing that still kind of persisted. And you know, now you see kind of others also kind of catching on to that. >> That's funny. I actually didn't know that. And that's extremely useful because I always have to open up a new

tab to like run any bash commands. So you just you just do an exclamation point and then it just like runs it directly instead of filtering it through all all the cloud stuff. >> Yeah. And quad code sees the full output too.

>> Interesting. That's perfect. >> So anything you see in the cloud code view, cloud code also sees. >> Okay, that's really interesting. >> And this is kind of a UX thing that we're thinking about. Like in the past tools were built for engineers, but now

it's equal parts engineers and model. >> And so like as an engineer, you can see the output, but it's actually quite useful for the model also. And this is part of the philosophy also like everything is dual use. Um so for example, the model can also call slash

commands. So like you know I have a slash command for slashcomit where I run through kind of a few different steps like diffing and generating a reasonable commit message and and this kind of stuff. I run it manually but also Claude can run this for me. Uh and this is

pretty useful because we get to share this logic. We get to kind of define this tool and then we we both get to use it. >> Yeah. What are the differences in uh designing tools that are dual use from designing tools that are you know used

by one or the other? Surprisingly, it's the same. >> Okay. >> So far. >> Yeah. I I I sort of feel like this kind of elegant design for humans translates really well to the models.

>> So, you're just thinking about what would make sense to you and the model generally, it makes sense to the model, too, if it makes sense to you. >> Yeah. I think one of the really cool things about Cloud Code being um a terminal UI and what made it work really

well is that Cloud Code has access to everything that an engineer does at the terminal. And I think when it comes to whether the tool should be dual use or not, I think making them dual use actually makes the tools a lot easier to understand. It just means that okay,

everything you can do, cloud code can do. There's nothing in between. >> Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, there there are a couple of those decisions. So, um no no code editor, it's in the terminal, so it has access to your files. Um, and

it's it's on your computer versus like in the cloud in a virtual machine. So you get like repeated you you get to use it in a repeated way where you can like you know build up your cloud MD file or you know like all all like build slash commands and all that kind of stuff

where it becomes very composable um and extensible from a very simple starting point. And I'm curious about how you think about, you know, for for people who are thinking about, okay, I want to build an agent, I want to build probably not cloud code, but like

something else, how you get that that simple package that then can extend and be really powerful over time. >> For me, I I start by just thinking about it like developing any kind of product where you have to solve the problem for yourself before you can solve it for

others. And like this is something that they teach in YC is you have to start with yourself. So like if you if you can solve your own problem, it's much more likely you're solving the problem for others. And I I think for coding starting locally is the reasonable thing

and you know now we have cloud code on the web. So you can also use it with a virtual machine and um you know you can use it in a remote setting and this is super useful when you're on the go you want to take that from your phone >> and and this is sort of we we started

proving this out kind of a step bat a time >> where you can do atcloud in GitHub and uh I use this every day like on the way to work I'm like at a red light I probably shouldn't be doing this but I'm like you know on GitHub at a red light

and then I'm like at claude you know fix this issue or whatever and so it's it's just real useful to be able to control it from your phone um and this kind proves out this experience. I I don't know if this necessarily makes sense for every kind of use case. For coding, I

think starting local is right. Um I don't know if this is true for everything, though. >> Got it. What are the slash commands you guys use?

>> Slashprit. >> Yeah. >> Um yeah, it it's I I think the pritcomand makes it a lot faster for claw to know exactly what bash commands to run in order to make a commit. >> And what does the prit slash command do

for people who are unfamiliar? Oh, it it just tells it like exactly how to make a commit. Okay. >> Um and you can like dynam you can say like, okay, these are the three bash commands that need to be run.

>> Got it. And and what's pretty cool is also we have um this kind of templating system built into slash commands. So we actually run the bash commands ahead of time. They're like embedded into the slash command. Um and you can also pre-allow certain tool invocations. So

for that slash command we say allow um you know get commit get push gh and so you don't get asked for permission after you run the slash command because we have like a permission uh based security system. Um and then also it uses haik coup which is pretty cool. Um so it's

kind of a cheaper model and faster. Um yeah and for me I I use like commit uh commit PR uh feature dev we use a lot. So like sid created this one. It's kind of cool. So it kind of like walks you through step by step um building something. So we prompt quad to like

first ask me how to what exactly I want like build the specification >> and then um you know kind of like build like a detailed plan and then make a to-do list walk through step by step. So it's kind of like more structured feature development

>> and then I think the last one that we probably use a lot so we use like security review for all of our PRs and then also code review. Um so like quad does all of our code review internally at anthropic. Um, you know, there's still a human approving it, but quad

does kind of the first step in code review. That's just a slashcode review command. >> Got it. Yeah. What are the things I would love to go deeper into like the how do you make a good plan? So, the sort of the feature dev thing because I

think there's a lot of like little tricks that um I'm starting to find or people at every start starting to find that work and I'm curious like what what are things that that we're missing. So for example, one um step in the one unintuitive step of the of the you know

plan development process is even if I don't exactly know what the thing that needs to be built is I just have like a little sentence in my mind like I want feature X I have Claude just like implement it just without giving it anything else and I see what it does and

that helps me understand like okay here's actually what I mean because it made all these different mistakes or like it it did something that I didn't expect that might be And then I use that like the learning from the sort of throwaway development.

I just clear it out. And then that helps me write a better plan spec for the actual feature development, which is something that you would never do before because it'd be too expensive to just like yolo send an engineer on a feature that you hadn't actually speced out. But

because you have cloud going through your codebase and doing stuff, you can like learn stuff from it. Um that helps inform the actual plan that you make. >> Yeah. I feel maybe I I can start and I'm curious how you use it too.

>> I think there's like a few different modes maybe for me like one one is prototyping mode. >> So like traditional engineering prototyping you want to kind of build the simplest possible thing that touches all the systems just so you can kind of

get a vague sense of like what are the systems there's unknowns and just to kind of trace through everything. >> Um and so I I do the exact same thing as you Dan like Claude just does the thing and then I see where it messes up and then I'll ask it to just throw it away

and do it again. So just hit escape twice, go back to the old checkpoint and then try again. I think there's also maybe two other kinds of tasks. So one is just things that quad can one-shot and I feel pretty confident it can do it. So I'll just tell it and then I'll

just go to a different tab and I'll I'll shift tap to auto accept and then just go do something else or go to another one of my quads and tend to that while it does this. >> Um but also there's this kind of like harder feature development. So these are

you know things are maybe in the past it would have taken like a few hours of engineering time and for this usually I would I'll shift tap into plan mode and then align on the plan first before it even writes any code. Um and and I think what's really hard about this is the

boundary changes with every model and it in kind of a surprising way where the newer models they're more intelligent so the boundary of what you need plan mode for got pushed out like a little bit >> like before you used to need to plan now now you don't. And I think it's this

general trend of like stuff that used to be scaffolding with a more advanced model, it gets pushed into the model itself and the model kind of tends to subsume everything over time. Yeah. How do you think about like building a agent harness that isn't just going to like

you're you're not spending a bunch of time um building stuff that is just going to be subsumed into the model in 3 months when the new cloud comes out?

like, yeah, how do you how do you know what to build versus what to just say it doesn't work quite yet, but next time it's going to work, so we're not going to spend time on it. >> I think we build most things that we think would improve Cloud Code's

capabilities, even if that means we'll have to get rid of it in 3 months. If anything, we hope that we will get rid of it in three months. >> I think for now, we just want to offer the most premium experience possible and so we're not too worried about throwaway

work. H >> interesting. Yeah. And an example of this is something like even like plan mode itself. I think we'll probably un ship it at some point when Quad can just figure out from your intent that you probably want to plan first. Um or you

know, for example, I just deleted like 2,000 tokens or something from the system prompt yesterday just cuz like Sonnet 45 doesn't need it anymore. Um but Opus Opus 41 did need it. What about um you know in the case where uh the the latest frontier you know model doesn't

need it but you know you're trying to figure out how to make it more efficient because you have so many users that you know you're maybe you you're not going to use Opus or Sonnet 45 for everything. Maybe you're going to use Haiku. So there's a trade-off between having a

more um elaborate harness for Haiku versus just like not spending time on it using Sonnet eating the cost and working on more Frontier type stuff. In general, we've positioned Quad Code to be a very premium offering. So, our north star is making sure that it works incredibly

well with the absolutely most powerful model we have, which is Sonnet 45 right now. >> Um, we are investigating how to make it work really well for like future generations of smaller models, but it's um it's not the top priority for us.

>> Okay. What do you think about um you know one thing that I notice is we get models um often and thank you very much for this. We get models a lot before they come out and it's our job to kind of figure out is it any good and over the last six months

when I'm testing claude for example in the claude app with a new frontier model it's actually very hard to tell whether it's how whether it's better immediately. Um, but it's really easy to tell in cloud code because the the harness matters a lot for the

performance that you get out of the model. And you guys have the benefit of building cla or building cloud code inside of the um inside of enthropic. So there's like a much tighter integration between um the fundamental like model training and the harness that you're

building and and they seem to kind of like really impact each other. So how does that how does that work internally and and um what are the benefits you get from having that like tight integration?

>> Yeah, I think the biggest thing is like researchers just use this and so you know as they see what's working, what's not, they can they can improve stuff. Um we do like a lot of eval to kind of communicate back and forth and understand where exactly the model's at.

Um, but yeah, there's this frontier where you need to give the model a hard enough task to really push the limit of the model. And if you don't do this, then all models are kind of equal. But if you give it a pretty hard task, you can you can tell the difference.

>> What sub aents do you use?

>> Um, I I have a few. I have like a planner sub agent that I use. I have a code review sub aent. Code review is actually something where sometimes I use a sub agent, sometimes I use a slash command. So usually in CI to slash command, but in synchronous use I use a

sub aent for the same thing. Um >> um it's a good question. Yeah, maybe it's like a matter of taste. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Um I think it's maybe when you're running synchronously, it's kind of nice to fork

off the the context window a little bit because all the stuff that's going on in the code review, it's not relevant to what I'm doing next. But in CI, it just doesn't matter. >> Are you ever spawning like 10 sub agents at once? And for what?

>> For me, I do it mostly for like big migrations. Okay, >> this like the big thing. Um, actually we have so this like coder slash command that we use there's a bunch of sub aents there and so one of the steps is like find all the issues and so there's one

sub agent that's like checking for quadmd compliance. There's another sub agent that's looking through git history to see what's going on. Another sub aent that's looking for kind of obvious bugs and then we do this like kind of dduping quality step after. So they find a bunch

of stuff. A lot of these are false positives and so then then we spawn like five more sub aents and these are all just like checking for false positives. And in the end, the result is awesome. It finds like all the real issues without the false issues.

>> That's great. I actually do that. Um, so one of my non-technical cloud code use cases is um expense filing. So like when I'm I'm in SF right now, so like I have all these expenses. And so I built this little cloud project that uh in in cloud code that um it uses uh one of these,

you know, finance APIs to just download all my credit card transactions. And then it uh decides like these are probably the expenses that I'm going to have to like file. And then I have two sub agents, one that represents me and one that represents the company. And

they like do battle to like figure out like what's the proper um like actual set of expenses. uh it's like an auditor sub agent and like you know pro Dan sub agent. So um yeah that kind of thing the the sort of like opponent processor uh pattern seems to be like an interesting

one. >> Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's it's cool. I I feel like when sub aents were first becoming a thing actually what inspired us there's like a Reddit thread a while back where someone made sub agents for like there was like a front end dev and

a backend dev and like a think it was like a designer >> testing dev >> testing dev like there was like a PM sub agent and this is like you know it's cute like it feels like a little maybe too anthropomorphic um maybe maybe

there's something to this but I I think like the value is actually like the uncorrelated context windows where you have like these two context windows that don't know about each other and this is kind of interesting um and you tend to get better results this way. What about

you? Do you have any interesting sub agents you use?

>> So, I've been tinkering with one um that is really good at front-end testing. So, it uses Playright to like see all right, what are like all the errors that are client side and pull them in and try to test more steps of the app. Um, it's not totally there yet, but I'm

seeing signs of life and I think it's the kind of thing that we could potentially um, bundle in one of our plugins marketplaces. >> Yeah. Um, definitely. I I' I've used something like that just with Puppeteer and just like watching it build

something and then open up the browser and then be like, "Oh, I need to change this." It's like this is like, "Oh my god." >> Yeah. It's really cool. >> It's really cool. I think I think we're starting to see the beginnings of this

like massive like multi- massive sub aents. I I don't know what they call this like swarms or something like that. There's a bunch of people there's actually an increasing number of people internally at anthropic that are using like a lot of credits every month like

you know like spending like over a thousand bucks every month. Um and this like this percent of people is growing actually pretty fast. And I think the common use case is like code migration. And so what they're doing is like framework A to framework B. uh there's

like the main agent, it makes a big to-do list for everything and then just kind of map produce over a bunch of sub agents. So you instruct quad like yeah like start 10 agents and then just go like you know 10 at a time and just migrate all all the stuff over.

>> That's interesting. What would be like a concrete example of the kind of migration that you're talking about?

>> I think the most classic is like lint rules. >> So there's like you know there's some kind of lint rule you're rolling out. There's no autofixer because it's like you know like as an analysis can't really it's kind of too simplistic for

it. Um I think other stuff is like framework migrations like um we just migrated from like one testing framework to a different one. That's a pretty common one where it's super easy to verify the output.

>> One of the things I found is and this is both for project projects inside of every and then just open source projects. It's like if you're someone building a product and you want to build a feature that's um been done before. So maybe like an an example that people

might need to implement a bunch is like memory. How do you do memory? Um because we have a bunch of different products internally, you can just like spawn cloud sub agents to be like how do these three other products do it? And there's like possibility for just like tacit

code sharing where you don't need to like have an API or you don't need to like ask ask anyone. You can just be like how does how do we do this already?

And then use the best practices to um uh to uh build your own. And you can also do that with open source because there's like tons of open source projects where people are like you know they've been working on memory for like a year and it's like really really good. You be

like what are the patterns that um people have figured out and which ones do I want to implement?

>> Totally. You can also connect your version control system. If you've built a similar feature in the past, cloud code can use those APIs like query GitHub directly and find how people implemented a similar feature in the past and read that code and um copy the

relevant parts. >> Yeah. Is there um have you found any use for like log files of okay you know here's here's the full history of like how I implemented it and like is that important to give to claude and and and how are you how are you um implementing

that or making it useful for it?

>> Some people swear by it. Uh there are some people at anthropic where for every task they do, they tell cloud code to write a diary entry in a specific format that just documents like what did it do, what did it try, why didn't it work, and then they even have these agents that

like look over the past memory and synthesize it into observations. >> I think this is like the starting budding >> like there's like something interesting here that we could productize. >> Um but it's a new emerging pattern that

we're seeing that works well. I think the hard thing about like oneshotting memory from just one transcript is that it's hard to know how relevant a specific instruction is to all future tasks. Like our canonical example is if I say make the button pink, I don't want

you to remember to make all buttons pink in the future. And so I think um synthesizing memory from a lot of logs is a is a way to um find these patterns more um consistently. It seems like you probably need like there's some things where you're going to know um you'll be

able to summar like synthesize or summarize in this sort of like top down way like this this will be useful later and and you'll you'll know the right level of abstraction at which it might be useful but then there's also a lot of stuff where it's like you actually you

know any given like commit log like make the button pink it could be useful for kind of an infinite number of different reasons um that you're not going to know beforehand. So you also need the the model to be able to look up all similar past, you know, commits and surface that

at the right time. Is that something that you're also thinking about? Yeah, I think I think there could there could be something like that. And maybe I think one way to see it is this kind of like traditional memory storage work like like mex like kind of stuff where you

just want to like put all the information into the system and then it's kind of a retrieval problem problem after that. Um, yeah. I think as the model also gets smarter, it naturally I've seen it start to naturally do this also with Sonnet 45

where if it's stuck on something, it'll just naturally start looking like we talked about before like using bash spontaneously. So just like look through git history and be like, "Oh, okay. Yeah, this is kind of an interesting way to do it."

>> Yeah. One of the things that like we were talking before we started recording, one of the um things that we're doing inside of every like I feel like it has really um change the way that we do engineering because everyone is cloud code build like CLI build and

um we have this engineering paradigm that we call compounding engineering where in normal engineering every feature you add it makes it harder to add the next feature and in compounding engineering your goal is to make the next feature easier to build um from the

feature that you just added. And the the way that we do that is we try to um codify all the learnings from um from everything that we've done to build the feature. So like you know how did we make the plan and and what parts of the plan needed to be changed or like when

we started testing it like what what issues did we find? What are the things that we missed? Um and then we codify them back into all the prompts and all the sub agents and all the slash commands so that the next time when someone does something like this uh it

catches it and that makes it easier. And that's why for me, for example, I can like hop into one of our code bases and start like being productive even though I'm I don't know anything about how the code works because we have this like builtup memory system of um of all the

stuff that we've learned as we've implemented stuff, but we've had to build that ourselves. I'm curious, are you working on that kind of loop so it the cloud code does that automatically?

>> Yeah, we're we're starting to think about it. Uh it's funny. We we're just uh we we heard the same thing from Fiona. She just joined the team. And you know, she she's our she's our manager. She hasn't coded in like 10 years, something like that. And she was landing

PRs on her first day. And she was like, "Yeah, like not only did I kind of I forgot how to code and quad code kind of made it super easy to just get back into it, >> but also I didn't need to ramp up on any context because I kind of knew all

this." And I think a lot of it is about like when people put up poll requests for quad code itself and I think our customers tell us that they do like similar stuff pretty often. Um if you see a mistake I'll just be like add quad add this to quad MD so that the next

time it just knows this automatically and you you can kind of like instill this memory in kind of a variety of ways. So you can say like at quad add it to quadmd. You can also say add quad write a test. You know, that's like easy way to make sure this doesn't regress.

And I don't feel bad asking anyone to write tests anymore, right? It's just like super easy. And like I think probably close to 100% of our tests are just written by Quad. And if they're bad, we just won't commit it. And then the good ones stay committed. Um, and

then also I think lint rules are a big one. So for stuff that's enforced pretty often, we actually have a bunch of internal lint rules. Claude writes 100% of these. Um, and this is mostly just like at Claude in a PR write write this lint rule. And yeah, there's sort of

this problem right now about like how how do you do this automatically? And I think generally how like Cat and I think about it is we see this like power user behavior and the first step is how do you enable that by making the product hackable so the best users can figure

out how to do this cool new thing >> but then really the hard work starts of like how do you take this and bring it to everyone else. Um, and for me, I I kept myself in the everyone else bucket. Like, you know, I don't really know how to use Vim. Like, I don't have this like

crazy like T-box setup. So, I have like a pretty vanilla setup. So, if you can make a feature that I'll use, it's a pretty good indicator that like other kind of average engineers will use it. That is interesting. Like, tell me about that because like that's something I

think about all the time is um making something that is extensible and flexible enough that power users can find like novel ways to use it that you would not have even dreamed of. But it's also simple enough that anyone can use it and it's and they can be productive

with it and you can you can kind of pull what the power users find back into like the basic experience. Like how do you think about making those design and product decisions so that you enable that?

>> In general we think that like every engine environment is a little bit different from the others and so it's really important that every part of our system is extensible. Um so everything from your status line to adding your own slash commands through to hooks which

let you um insert a bit of determinism at pretty much any step in quad code. So we think these are the these are like the basic building blocks that we give to every engineer that they can play with. um for plugins. Plugins is actually our um so it was built by Daisy

on our team and this is this is our attempt to make it a lot easier for the average user like us um to bring these slashcomands and hooks into our workflows. And so what plugins does is it lets you browse existing MCP servers, existing hooks, existing plugins and

just like or sorry existing like sash commands and just let you write one command in quad code to pull pull that in for yourself. >> There's this like really old idea in product called latent demand which I think is probably the main way that I

personally think about product and like thinking about what to build next is it's a super simple idea. It's you build a product in a way that is hackable that is kind of open-ended enough that people can abuse it for other use cases it wasn't really designed for. Then you see

how people abuse it and then you build for that cuz like you you kind of know there was demand for it, >> right?

>> Um and like you know when I when I was at Meta, this is how we built kind of all the big products. I think almost every single big product had this nugget of latent demand in it. um you know like for example something like Facebook dating it came from this idea that when

uh we looked at who looks at people's profiles I think 60% of views were between people of opposite gender so kind of like traditional setup that were not friends with each other and so we're like oh man okay maybe there's like maybe if we like launch a dating product

we can kind of harness this demand that exists >> that's interesting >> and for you know marketplace it was pretty similar I think it was like 40% of posts in Facebook groups at the time were by sell posts and so I Okay, people

are trying to use this product to buy themselves. We just build a product around it that's probably going to work. And so we think about it kind of similarly, but also we have the luxury of building for developers and developers love hacking stuff and they

love customizing stuff and it's like as a user of our own product, it makes it so fun to build and and use this thing. Um, and so yeah, like like I said, we just build the right extension points. We see how people use it and that kind of tells us what to build next. Like for

example, we got all these user requests where people were like, "Dude, Quad Code is asking me for all these permissions and I'm out here getting coffee. I don't know that it's asking me for permissions. How could I just get it to like ping me on Slack?" And so we built

hooks. Uh Dixon built hooks um so that people could get pinged on Slack and you could get pinged on Slack for anything that you want to get pinged on Slack for. Um, and so it was very much like people really wanted the ability to do something. We didn't want to build the

integration ourselves. And so we we exposed hooks for people to do that. >> The thing that makes me think of is um you you recently um released you kind of moved or rebranded how you talk about cloud code to be this like more general purpose agent SDK. Is that was that

driven by some latent demand where you you sort of saw there's like a more general purpose use case for what you built?

>> We realized that similar to how you were talking about using cloud code for things outside of coding, we saw this happen a lot like um we get a ton of stories of people who are using cloud code to like help them write a blog and like manage all the like data inputs and

take a first pass in their own tone. Um we find people building like email assistants on this. Um I use it for a lot of just like market research. Um because at the core it's like an agent that can just go on for an infinite amount of time as long as you give it a

concrete task and it's able to fetch the right underlying data. So one of the things I was working on was I wanted to look at all the companies in the world and how many engineers they had and to create a ranking. And this is something that quad code can do even though it's

not a traditional coding use case. So we realized that like the underlying primitives were really general as long as you give as long as you have like an agent loop that can continue running for a long period of time and you're able to like access the internet and write code

and run code pretty much you can if you squint you can kind of build anything on it. Mhm. >> And and I think like by at the point where we like rebranded it so like from the quad code SDK to the quad Asian SDK, there was already like many thousands of

companies using this thing and a lot of those use cases were not about coding. So it's like both both internally and externally. We kind of saw that >> like health assistants, like financial analysts, legal assistance. Um it was pretty broad.

>> Yeah. What are the coolest ones?

I feel like actually you you had Noah Brier on the the podcast recently. I thought like the obsidian like kind of mind mapping notekeeping use case is really cool. It's funny. It's insane how many people use it for this >> particular combination. Uh I think some

other like some coding or kind of coding adjacent use cases that are kind of cool is um we have this like issue tracker for quad code. The team's just like constantly underwater like trying to keep up with all the issues coming in.

There's just so many. And so I quad ddupes the issues and it automatically finds duplicates and it's extremely good at it. It also does first pass resolution. So usually when there's an issue it'll um proactively put up a PR internally and this is a new uh thing

that Enigo on the team built. Um so this is pretty cool. Uh there's also like on call and kind of collecting signals from other places like getting like sentry logs and getting like logs from BigQuery and kind of collating all this. um plus just really good at doing this because

it's all just bash in the end, right?

>> And so these are all kind of these internal use cases that that I saw. >> Is it um so when it's you know collating logs or um you doing issues is that like you have clouds like continually running in the background and is that something that you're building for?

>> Um it gets triggered for that particular one. It gets triggered whenever a new issue is filed. So it runs once but it can choose to run for as long as it needs. >> Got it. What about the idea of clouds always running? Oo, proactive quads. I

think it's definitely where we want to get to. U I would say right now we're very focused on making quad code incredibly reliable for like individual tasks. And you know, if you think about like if you think about like multi-line autocomplete and then like single turn

agents and then now we're working on like quad code that can complete tasks. I feel like if you trace this curve eventually you go to even higher levels of abstraction like even more complicated tasks and then hopefully the next step after that is a lot more

productivity. So just understanding what your team's goals are what your goals are being able to say hey I think you probably want to try this feature and here's a first pass at the code and here are the assumptions I made and are these correct?

>> I can't wait. Um and I think probably right after that is um Claude is now your manager. Um, >> that's not in the plan. >> So, everyone on the team was like super excited that uh we were we were talking

today and they gave me a bunch of questions and I want to make sure I I hit all the questions. Um, uh, oh, here's a good one. Why did you choose agentic rag over vector search in your architecture? And are like vector embeddings uh still relevant? Um so

actually initially we did use vector embeddings. Um they're just a really tricky to maintain because you have to continuously reindex the code and they might get out of date and you have local changes. So those need to make it in.

And then as we thought about what does it feel like for an external enterprise to adopt it, we realized that this exposes a lot more surface area and like security risk. Um we also found that actually cloud code is really good and cloud models are really good at agentic

search. So um you can get to the same accuracy level with agentic search and it's just a much cleaner deployment story. >> H that's really interesting. >> Um if you do want to bring semantic search to quad code, you can do so via

an MCP tool. So if you want to manage your own index and expose an MCP tool that lets Quad Code call that, that that would work. What do you think are the top MCPS to use with cloud code?

>> Puppeteer and Playright are pretty high up there. >> Definitely. Yeah. >> Century has a really good one. Asana has a really good one. Hm. Do you think that there are um any any power user tips that you see

people inside of anthropic or you know other people who are you know big power you know inside of organizations that are big cloud code power users that people don't know about but they should. Um, one thing that QuadCo doesn't naturally like to do, but that I

personally find very useful is, um, QuadCo doesn't naturally like to ask questions, but you know, if you're brainstorming with a thought partner, a collaborator, usually you do ask questions back and forth to each other.

And so, this is one of the things that, um, I like to do, especially in plan mode. I'll just tell Cloud Code like, "Hey, we're just brainstorming this thing. Um, please ask me questions if there's anything you're unsure about." um I want you to ask questions and it'll

do it. And I think that actually helps you arrive at a better answer >> there. There's like there's also like so many tips that we can share. I think like there there's a few really common mistakes I see people make. One is like like you said like not using plan mode

enough. This is this is just super important. And I think this is people that are kind of new to a coding. They kind of assume this thing can do anything and it can't. It's like not that good today and it's going to get better but today it can oneshot some

tests. can't one-shot most things. Um, and so you kind of have to understand the limits and you have to understand like where you get in the loop. And so like something like plan mode, it can like two 3x success rates pretty easily if you like land on the plan first. Um,

other stuff that I've seen power users do really well is companies that have really big deployments of quad code and now um, you know, luckily there's a lot of these companies so we can kind of learn from them. Uh having settings JSON that you check into the codebase is

really important because you can use this to pre-allow certain commands so you don't get permission prompted every time and also to block certain commands. Let's say you don't want web fetch or whatever and this way as an engineer I don't get prompted and um I can check

this in and share it with the whole team so everyone gets to use it. >> I I get around that by just using dangerous they skip permissions. >> Yeah, we kind of we kind of have this here but we don't you know we don't recommend it. It's like it's a model,

you know, it can do it can do weird stuff. Um, I think another kind of cool use case that we've seen is people using stop hooks for interesting stuff. So stop hook runs whenever the turn is complete. So like the assistant did some tool calls back and forth with you know

whatever and uh it's done and it returns control back to the user then we run the stop hook and so you can define a stop hook that's like um if the tests don't pass return the text keep going and essentially it's like you can just like make the model like keep going until the

thing is done and this is just like insane when you combine it with the SDK and this kind of programmatic usage >> you can you know this is a stochcastic thing it's a nondeterministic thing but with scaffolding you can get these determin deterministic outcomes.

>> So you guys started this sort of CLI, this CLI paradigm shift. Um, do you think the CLI is the final form factor?

Are we are we going to using cloud code in the CLI primarily in a year or in three years, or is there something else that's better?

>> I mean, it's not the final form factor, but we are very focused on making sure the CLI is like the most intelligent that we can make it and that's as customizable as possible. you can talk about the next form factors.

>> Yeah, I mean cat C's asking me to talk about because no one knows like this this stuff's like it's just moving like so fast, right?

Like no no one knows what these form factors are. Like right now I think our team is in experimentation mode. So we have uh CLI then we came out with the ID extension. Now we have a new ID extension that's like a guey. It's a little more accessible. Um we have add

quad and github so you can just add quad anywhere. Um, now there's at quad, there's quad on web and on mobile, so you can use it on any of these places. Um, and we're just in experimentation mode, so we're trying to figure out what's next. I think like if we kind of

zoom out and see where this stuff is headed. I think one of the big trends is longer periods of autonomy. And so with every model, we kind of time how long can the model just keep going and do tasks autonomously and just, you know, in dangerous mode in a container, keep

autocompacting until the task is done. And now we're on the order of like double digit hours. I think it's like the last model is like 30 hours, something like this. And I, you know, the next model is going to be days. And as you think about kind of parallelizing

models, um there's kind of a bunch of problems that come out of this. So one is what is the container this thing runs in because you don't want to have to like close your laptop. I have that right now because I'm doing a lot of uh disb I

don't know I've only heard I've only read it but DSPY or disb prompt optimization and like it's on my laptop and it's like I don't want to close I'm like in the way middle like with my laptop open because I'm like I don't want to close it. Yeah.

>> Yeah. That's right. Yeah. We've like visited companies before like like customers that everyone's just like walking around with their like quad codes. >> Is this running? So, I think like one is kind of getting getting away from this

mode and then I also think pretty soon we're going to be in this mode of like quads monitoring quads. >> Yeah. >> Um and kind of I I don't know what the right form factor for this is because as as a human you need to be able to

inspect this and kind of see what's going on. Um but also it needs to be quad optimized where um you're optimizing for kind of bandwidth between like the quad to quad communication. Um so my prediction is terminal is not the final form factor. My prediction is

there's going to be a few more form factors in the coming months, you know, maybe like year or something like that. And it's going to keep changing very quickly. >> What do you think about, you know, I teach a lot of cloud code to a lot of

every subscribers and >> thank you. >> You're welcome. Doing doing your work for you. Um uh and I think the like one of the big things is just the terminal is intimidating and uh just like being on a

call with subscribers being like here's how you open the terminal and you're allowed to do this even if you're non-technical is like a big deal. How do you think about that? Yeah, I um one of the people on our marketing team uh started using cloud code because she was

writing some content that touched on cloud code and I was like you should really experience it and she got like 30 popups on her screen where she had to accept various permissions because she'd never used a terminal before. So I completely see eye to eye with you on

that. It's definitely um hard for non-engineers and there's even some engineers we've found who aren't fully comfortable with working day-to-day in the terminal. Um, our VS Code GUI extension is our first step in that direction because you don't have to

think about the terminal at all. It's like a traditional interface with a bunch of buttons. Um, I think we are working on more um graphical interfaces. Uh, so quad code on the web is a guey. I think that actually might be a good starting point for people who are less

technical. >> Yeah. Yeah. There there was this like magic moment maybe like a few months ago where like I walked into the office and the some of the data scientists at Anthropic like sit right next to the quad code team and the data scientist

just had like quad code running on their computers and I was like what what is this like how did you figure this out? I think it was like Brandon uh was like the first one to do it and he was like, "Oh yeah, I just like installed it. Like I work on this product so like I should

use it." And I was like, "Oh my god." So he like he figured out how to like use a terminal and JS like you know he hasn't really done this kind of workflow before. Obviously like very technical. Um so I think now we're we're starting to see all these kind of like code

adjacent uh like functions. people you use quad code and um yeah it's kind of interesting like from a latent demand point of view these are people hacking the product so there's like demand to use it for this and so we want to make

it a little bit easier with more accessible interfaces but at the same time for us for quad code we're laser focused on building the best product for the best engineers and so um we're focused on software engineering and we want to make this like really good but

we want to make it a thing that other people can can hack >> some sometimes cloud code will write code that's a bit verbose post. Um, but you can just tell it to simplify it and it does a really good job.

>> Interesting. And so, and how are how and when are you doing that? So, you're you're using a slash command or you're >> I just say it. I just >> Sometimes you're like, "Hey, this should be a oneline change and I'll write five lines and you're like, simplify it and

it understands immediately what you mean and it'll fix it." >> Yeah. I think a lot of people on our team do that, too. Um, that's that's interesting. Why do you like why not then if you're saying that all the time why not then you know push that into

like a slash command or the harness or something like that to yeah make it just happen automatically. >> We do have instructions for this in the cloud MD. I think it impacts such a low percentage of conversations that we don't want it to like over rotate in the

other direction. >> Um and then the reason why not a slash command is because you actually don't need that much context. I think slash command's really good for situations where you would otherwise need to write two three lines but for simp like even

for plan mode you actually can use a few words but sometime but it actually takes two or three lines to capture the entirety of what you want in plan mode. Um for simplify it you can just write simplify it and it gets it.

>> Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool. >> Yeah. >> Um okay, now we're we can um that's interesting. Yeah, but but this stuff like you know it still feels just so early. >> Yeah.

>> You know, like we we were talking before before the recording about like kind of where are we on the adoption curve and it still >> the hian curve or whatever whatever that term was. >> Exactly. And it just feels it just feels

like we're you know like first 10% still like the stuff is going to change so fast it's going to keep changing. Even when I talk to researchers outside of enthropic who who abuse quad code um they also get stuck on things like this like not realizing that they can just

tell the LLM to simplify it and I think that just goes to show that even for people who are like working in this industry they don't always realize that you can just talk to the model. That's the thing is like I I think that there's this underlying expectation that using

AI shouldn't have to be a skill like because it just does whatever you say and you're like well I mean whatever you say is going to matter for what it does. So if you can say things better it's going to do better.

>> Yeah. I mean it it changes with every model though. That's the that's the hard part. like you know prompt engineer was a job and now famously it's not a job anymore and there's going to be more jobs that are then like not not jobs anymore of these kind of like little

micro skills that you have to learn to use this thing and as the model gets better it can just like interpret it better >> but I think that's also like for us this is part of this kind of humility that we have to have building a product like

this that we just really don't know what's next and we're just trying to figure it out kind of along with everyone else we're just here for the ride >> and that's why it's cool that you're building it for yourself cuz I think

that's the that's the best way to know that is just like you're and this is what we do too is like you're sort of living in the future. You're using it all the time. And uh it's pretty clear what's missing. You're like I just want this thing and you can just do the next

thing rather than being like hm let me ask like some enterprise product manager at like some gigantic company like what kind of AI feature do you want? And they're like I don't know like you know put a little chatbot on the side of my you know IDE and you're like okay.

>> Yeah. >> Yeah. This is like the luxurious thing about building dev tools right you're your own customer. I think it's also really um a unique thing about AI because um it sort of reset the game board for all software. So

um you know we have Kora this like email assistant and we have like Sparkle which organizes your files and it's like anything that you do for something that you want to use on your computer if you're if you're building it with AI there's a good chance that hasn't been

done before because like the whole whole landscape has been reset. And so it's a it's a uniquely exciting time to build stuff for yourself. >> Totally. I think it totally opens the playing field, too. It's like any individual can now build an app to fill

their need and then distribute it to everyone else. >> Yeah, >> it's really cool. >> I've been prototyping all these like random pet projects. Um >> um I just moved into a new apartment and

it's empty. And so I've been um I've been building this like shopping advisor assistant on like the Cloud Agent SDK cuz who has time to like read all the reviews and like look at all the options and find their pricing and everything's like really hard to discover. And so it

just like asks me a bunch of questions and I tell it what I want and it shows me a bunch of Yeah, exactly. and it shows me a bunch of photos of like different sofas and options and what people say online >> and then I tell it what I don't like and

it's literally feels like working with a shopping assistant >> and it it's been really cool. >> That's really cool. >> Um I also have my little email response agent that like drafts responses for me but I don't use email that much so

>> Oh, and I knew it wasn't you responding. >> That's why it's seven days delayed. The agent's just take doing a very thorough job. >> Yeah, >> agent SDK is cool though. >> Yeah, agent SDK is cool.

>> Yeah, it's it always just feels amazing like how much we're able to build with such a small team. >> Yeah. >> So, I feel like >> the other thing that's really cool is that I think people are just shifting

their mindset from docs to demos. Like internally, our currency is actually demos. It's like you want people to be excited about your thing. Yeah, >> show us like show us 15 seconds of what it can do. >> And we find that everyone on the team

now has this kind of indoctrinated >> demo culture for sure. And I think that's better because >> there's a lot of things that you might have in your head that if you're a great writer, maybe you could figure out how to explain it, but it's just even then

it's just really hard to explain. But if someone can see it, they like get it immediately. And I think that's happening for product building, but it's also happening for like all sorts of other types of creative endeavors like making a movie for example. Like you had

to pitch it, but now you can just be like I made this Sora video and like you know check like you can kind of see like like the glimmer of the thing you're trying to make for very cheap. And so that means you don't have to spend time convincing people as much. You can just

be like here I made it. >> Yeah. And and also as a builder like you can just make it and then like make it again and then make it again until you're happy. Like >> I I feel like that like the flip side is like you used to make a dock or you know

like whiteboard something or you know like I I would draw stuff in like Sketch or Figma or whatever and now we'll just like build it until until I like how it feels. >> And it's just like so easy to get that feeling out of it now. And I I think

it's like you could see it visually before or you could describe it in words but it's like you could never get the vibe. And now like the vibe is really easy. >> Yeah. And you built plan mode like three times.

>> Yeah. Yeah. >> Because of this. >> Like you you built it and then you threw it out and rebuilt it and then threw it out and rebuilt it. >> Yeah. Or like Tudos's uh like Sid built the original version like also like

three or four he built like three or four prototypes and then I prototype maybe like 20 versions after that like in like a day. Yeah. I think this is like a lot of pretty much everything we released there was at least a few prototypes behind it. How do you like um

keep track of and carry forward the things you learn from prototype to prototype? And especially if it's like, you know, some one person is prototyping it and then you're like, I'm going to take it over. I'm going to do 20 more.

Like how do you how do you maximize what you get out of that?

You know, it's it's like there there's maybe a few elements of it. One is the style guide. So there's like some elements of style that we discover. And I think a lot of this is like building for the terminal or like we're kind of discovering a new design language for

for the terminal and kind of building it as we go. Um, and I think some of this you can codify in a style guide. So this is our quad MD, but then there's this other part of it that's like kind of product sense where I don't think the model totally gets it yet. And I think

maybe we should be trying to find ways to like teach the model this this kind of product sense about like this works and this doesn't, right? Because in in product, you want to solve the person's problem in the simplest way possible and then delete everything else that's not

that and just get everything out of the way. So you kind of you you align the product to the intent as cleanly as possible. And maybe the model doesn't totally get that yet. >> Yeah. It's never it doesn't really feel what it's like to use quad code. Like

the model doesn't use quad code. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so I think like when you know like quad code can like test itself and it can kind of use itself. Um and like we we do this when developing and it can see like UI bugs and things like that.

I don't know maybe we should just try prompting it though. It could like honestly a lot of the stuff is as simple as that. Like when there's some new idea usually you just prompt it and often it just works. Maybe we should just try that.

>> A lot of the prototypes are actually the UX interactions. Um, and so I think once we discover a new UX interaction like shift tab for auto accept, I think uh Boris figured out. Um, then >> that was Eigor actually.

>> Oh, Eigor. >> Yeah, we went back and forth can like fit into that. >> We did like dueling prototypes for like a week. >> Yeah, shift tab felt really nice. And then one of the the now current plan

mode iteration um uses shift tab because it's actually just like another way to tell the model how agentic it should be. >> And so I think as as more features use the same uh interaction, you form like a stronger mental model for what should go where.

>> Yeah. Or like thinking I think is another really good one. Like first we were like before we released quad code or maybe it was like the first thinking model was it like 37? I forget what the first one was.

>> Yeah. >> But yeah and it it was like it was able to think and we're like brainstorming like how do we like toggle thinking? And then someone was just like what if you just like ask the model to think in natural language and it knows how to

think and we're like okay sweet let's do that. And so like we we did that for a while and then um we realized that people were accidentally toggling it. So they were like don't think and then the model was like oh I should think. it just started

thinking >> and so we had to kind of like tune it out so you know don't think didn't trigger it but then it still wasn't obvious but then we made a UX improvement to like highlight the thinking that

>> and that was like that was so fun and it felt really magical >> when you do ultra think it's like rainbow or whatever exactly and then with uh with sonet 45 we actually find like a really really big performance improvement when you turn on extended

thinking um and so uh we made it really easy to toggle it because sometimes you want it sometimes you because you you kind of for a really simple task, you don't want the model to think for like five minutes. You want it to just do the thing. And so we used tab as the

interaction to toggle it. And then we unchipped a bunch of the thinking words. Although I I think we kept ultra think just for like sentimental reasons. It was such a cool UX. >> Interesting. Do you think there's some there's some new metric that's about

what you deleted? And I I think programmers have always felt like, you know, deleting a bunch of code feels really good, but there's something about because you can build stuff so fast, it becomes more important to like also delete stuff.

I think my favorite kind of diff to see is a red diff. This is the best whenever I'm like, "Yeah, bring it on. Another one. Another one." Um, but it, you know, but it's hard because like anything you ship, people are using it. And so you got to keep people happy. And so I think

generally our principle is if we un ship something, we need to ship something even better. um that can kind of um that people can can take advantage of that that kind of matches that intent uh even better. Um and yeah, I think this is kind of back to like how do you measure

like quad code and the impact of it and this is something like every company every customer asks us about and I think like in so internally at anthropic I think we like doubled in size since January or something like that but then productivity per engineer has increased

like almost 70% in that time. um >> measured by >> uh I think we actually measured it yeah in a few ways but kind of PRs are the the simplest one and the main one um but like you said like this doesn't capture the full extent of it because a lot of

this is like making it easier to prototype making it easier to try new things making it easier to these things that you never would have tried because they're way below the cut line. Um you're launching a feature and there's this kind of like wish list of stuff now

you just do all it because it's so easy >> and you just wouldn't have done it. >> So yeah, it's really hard to talk about it. And then there's this flip side of it where more code is written. So you have to delete more code. You have to code review more carefully and you know

automate automate code review as much as you can. There's also like an interesting like new product management challenge because you can ship so much that you end up it it ends up not feeling as cohesive because you could just like add button here and like a tab

there and like a little thing here. Like it's just it's much easier to build a product that has all the features you want but doesn't have any sort of organizing principle because you're just shipping lots of stuff all the time. I think we try to be pretty disciplined

about this and making sure that all the abstractions are really easy to understand for someone even if they just hear the name of the feature. We have this principle that I believe Boris brought to the team that I really like where we don't want a new user

experience. Everything should be so intuitive that you just drop in and it just works. And I think that's that's really set the bar really high for making sure every feature is really intuitive. How do you do that with um a conversational UI? Because um you know

when there's not a bunch of but buttons and knobs and it's just a blank text box to start, how do you think about making it intuitive?

>> Um there's a lot of like little things that we do like um we teach people that they can use the question mark to see tips. Um we show tips as quad code is working. We have like the change log on the side. um we tell you about like oh there's a new model that's out or like

we show you at the bottom we have a notification section for thinking. I think there's just like subtle ways in which we tell users about features. I think the other thing that's really important is to just make sure that all the primitives are very clearly defined

like hooks have a common meaning um in the developer ecosystem. plugins have a very common meaning in the developer ecosystem and just making sure that what we build matches what like the you know the average developer would immediately think of when they hear that

>> there there's this also this like progressive disclosure thing like you know to to any anytime in quad code when you run it you can hit control O to see like the full raw transcript the same thing the model sees and we don't like show you this until it's actually

relevant so when there's a tool result that's collapsed then we'll say use control O to see it so we kind of we don't want to put too much complexity on you at the start because this thing can do you know anything. Um I think there's this other kind of new principle which

we've just started exploring which is like the model teaches you how to use the thing and so you can ask quad code about itself and it it kind of knows to look up its own documentation to tell you about it but we can also go even deeper like for example slash commands

are a thing that people can use but also the model can call slash commands and maybe you see the model calling it and then you'll be like oh yeah I guess I can do that too. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. How has it changed like you know when you first

started doing this cloud code was this sort of like singular thing this singular way of thinking about you know using AI through a CLI other people had stuff like this but it it felt like this shift and now there's a whole landscape of everyone is like going CLI CLI CLI

like how has that changed how you think about building how it feels to build and how are you dealing with the sort of pressure of the race that you're in? I >> think for for me like imitation is the greatest flattery. Mhm. Um, so it's like it, you know, it's it's awesome and it's

just like it's cool to see all this other stuff that everyone else is building like inspired by this. And I think this is ultimately the goal is to kind of inspire people to build this next thing for this just incredible technology that's that's coming. And

that that's just really exciting. Personally, I don't really use a lot of other tools. So, usually when something new comes out, I'll I'll maybe just try it to get a vibe. Um, but otherwise I think we're pretty focused on just solving problems that we have and our

customers have and kind of building the next thing. >> Cool. Sweet. Um, I I loved this part of the interview, too. >> Did we answer all of your team's

questions?

>> Questions?

>> Do Oh, did we get through all my team's questions? Let's see. Uh, I think we did. Um, uh, I'm curious also how you would answer like the unshipping question cuz also like if you're doing this kind of like

AIdriven development, you ship a lot. You have a small team, so it's a lot of operational load. >> The reason I asked that is because I don't think we do a good job of that. Um, and

I have this feeling that some of the products are like a little bit messy because of that. And I think particularly for Kora, um there's just a big product surface area and it can do a lot of different things

like it we have an email assistant so you can ask it like you know uh tell me about the trip I'm taking and it'll go through all your emails and you know summarize the the trip. Um or we have this feature that it automatically archives any email that you don't need

to respond to immediately. Um, and then twice a day you get a brief that summarizes all the stuff that you probably need to see but you don't need to like actually do anything with and you just scroll through it and you're done. Um, and there's just like all this

there's all this complexity that around you know for example how are emails categorized? So now we have a whole view of we have all these categorization rules and you can order them and whatever, but like it's just complicated and hard to communicate and

and uh and I want to retain a lot of the like all the power and flexibility, but also you can't look at a screen and be like I have no idea what's going on. This is like way too complicated. So that's I'm just like I'm processing all that stuff. So the the kind of like

deletion, you know, un unshipping idea feels like an interesting um cultural principle that we haven't really explored. >> Yeah, it's really hard. I think there's like a social cost to it, too, where like you kind of want to be the person

who tells your coworker to unship their thing. >> It's definitely tricky. It's more than just the code. Yeah, I I definitely learned this at Instagram honestly cuz I I think Facebook does a terrible job at unshipping and we had this problem where

>> every time we I think even like unshipping pokes was like really spicy cuz there's a bunch of these like old-timers. They're like, "No pokes, you're never going to take it away." But like if you look at the data, no one really uses it anymore.

>> But for sentimental reasons, they were kind of tied to it. >> And so like for Facebook, it always maybe nothing ever got unchipped. It always got moved to like a secondary place like a, you know, like an overflow menu somewhere that no one looks at,

like a graveyard. >> Yeah. >> And I think Instagram was just very principled. There was like, you know, very strong in a product and design point of view that was like, if this thing isn't used by like half of people,

you know, 50% of WOW or whatever, we're just going to delete it and deal with it and then we'll figure out some next thing that's used by more people. >> I love it. Um, well, thank you. This was amazing. I'm really uh glad I got to talk to you and uh keep building.
